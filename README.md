#### Project Name : &nbsp;<strong> शहमात </strong>

<p>During these COVID times we see that almost all exams are being
taken online. However, cheating is a major issue that is being faced in
these exams. We aim to design an online cheat detection system to detect
cheating in online tests and hence prevent it. Manual proctoring is not feasible if the count of candidates to be proctored becomes large.
Moreover, kids today are smart enough to think of hacks, to cheat out of manual or in-person proctoring. In this project, we are aiming to design an AI based proctoring envoirnment, which will bring efficiency in cheat detection and prevention.<p>
